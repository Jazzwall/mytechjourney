# My Tech Journey

The tech space is ever changing and evolving. I love learning and trying new things in this space. This repo is my notes as I learn about new things.

  

## Why?

Things distract me easily. The purpose of this repo is to stabilize my explorations and learnings. I plan on documenting my experience and what I learn.

  

## My Setup

This repo is a placeholder for an [Obsidian Vault](https://obsidian.md). I love Obsidian. It is not open source (at the moment) but the best thing out there (better than Roam).

I am using Github Actions to publish a website of everything in the docs subdirectory.  Based on [this template](https://github.com/jobindj/obsidian-publish-mkdocs).
